# Requirements
## Introduction
 #### This is a simple calculator program which is used by people in their day to day life for small calculation.
 #### In this program the user can easily do the basic calculaion using this program.
 #### The user can add, subtract,multiply,divide the numbers if required.
 #### For example, this calculator program can be used by shopkeeper for calculating and totaling the bis for generating the bill manually

## Research
#### In this program I have used diff function ,if-else,switch,for loops etc.

## SWOT Analysis
### S-STRENGTHS
 #### The strength of this program is that it is user friendly and anyone can easily operate it.
 #### The user can easily save time by using this.
### W-WEAKNESS
 #### The majaor drawback of this calculator is that difficult problems cannot be executed.
 #### Not all functions are given in this only basic functions are in this.
### O-OPPORTUNITY
 #### Calculator saves time and is every efficient to use anyone can easily learn and use it.
 #### sponsoring different events and working towards the educational improvement campaigns can add more segments to their customer base.
### T-THREATS
 #### Its getting hard for Casio to enter sports and other tech-product lines as thereâ€™re already many strong brands are ruling. 
 #### Their slower growth in technological innovation will also bring a significant threat in the upcoming dynamic world.

## CONCLUSION
 #### A simple user interface has been created to demonstrate the calculator. 
 #### The interface addresses the problem of allowing the user to view a (potentially time consuming) calculation as it proceeds but also giving an answer which can be used or checked, by outputting signed digits as they are computed and then converting the result into decimal when some specified precision is reached.
